## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please send vulnerability reports to <valent@andyholmes.ca>. Reports sent to
this address will be redirected to my personal e-mail, but will ensure they
are given a high-priority and not end up in a spam folder.

I'll respond to any report as soon as possible, but please allow me a reasonable
amount of time to review the matter. I may need additional details, but I will
extend you the same courtesy and give you time to respond.
