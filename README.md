Valent is an implementation of the [KDE Connect][kdeconnect] protocol, built on

## Status

This project is currently in alpha. It generally works as intended, but is still
missing some features and may contain bugs.

If that's okay with you, there is a [nightly Flatpak][nightly-flatpakref] that
you can try out. It includes the nightly Flatpak repository, so you'll get
updates along with your other applications.
